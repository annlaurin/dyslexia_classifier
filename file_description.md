*updated_lstm_for_reading_v1* - an lstm that uses updated centering and scaling, adds reading speed (true) and demographic features after the lstm unit. AUC 0.97-0.98. The not-cleaned-up but working version is *updated_lstm_for_reading_added_speed_works_not_cleaned_up*.

*Speed_prediction_nestedCV* - an LSTM that predicts reading speed. It uses updated centering and scaling, adds demographic features after the lstm unit. Data preprocessor returns X, y, subj, and reading speed (!), this preprocessor would be useful in the final version of the enhanced LSTM that deals with x, y, subj, and reading speed.
