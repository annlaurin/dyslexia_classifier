Dyslexia detection project
================================================================================

## Project overview
This repository contains the code and data necessary to reproduce the results reported in ''''. The goal of the project is to evaluate and compare two models that automatically classify dyslexia based on readers' eye movements.

## Usage guide
To run the baseline LSTM model, please run the baseline_LSTM/experiment.py file. 
To run the the new models (an enhanced LSTM and a pre-trained transformer classifier), please refer to folder 'transformer_fix_sequence' and to the readme file in the folder.
